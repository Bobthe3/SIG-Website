# üìù Member Management Guide for Non-Technical Users

This guide explains how to easily update the SIG website's member information without needing any coding skills.

## üéØ Quick Overview

Your website uses a simple **JSON file** to store all member information. Think of it like a digital spreadsheet that the website reads to display member cards automatically.

## üìä How the Members Page Works

The members page has three sections:
1. **Executive Board** - Leadership team with roles
2. **General Members** - All other active members, organized by year
3. **Alumni** - Graduated members with their current jobs

Each member card shows:
- Photo
- Name  
- Major/Role
- Year/Company
- Interest area (for current members)
- LinkedIn profile link

## üîÑ Weekly Update Process (Recommended)

### Method 1: Direct JSON Editing (Simplest)

1. **Open the member data file**: Navigate to `data/members.json` in your website folder
2. **Edit member information** using any text editor (even Notepad works!)
3. **Save the file**
4. **Upload to your website** (if using GitHub Pages, just commit the changes)

### Method 2: Spreadsheet-to-JSON Converter (Coming Soon)

I'll create a simple tool that lets you:
1. Update a Google Sheets spreadsheet
2. Export as CSV
3. Convert to JSON automatically
4. Upload to website

## üîß JSON File Structure Explained

The `members.json` file has three sections:

```json
{
  "executiveBoard": [
    {
      "name": "Full Name",
      "role": "Position Title", 
      "major": "Academic Major",
      "year": "Senior/Junior/etc",
      "image": "assets/members/photo-filename.jpg",
      "linkedin": "https://linkedin.com/in/username"
    }
  ],
  "generalMembers": [
    {
      "name": "Full Name",
      "major": "Academic Major",
      "year": "Senior/Junior/etc", 
      "interest": "ESG Research/etc",
      "image": "assets/members/photo-filename.jpg",
      "category": "senior/junior/sophomore/freshman"
    }
  ],
  "alumni": [
    {
      "name": "Full Name",
      "role": "Job Title",
      "company": "Company Name", 
      "year": "Class of 2023",
      "image": "assets/members/photo-filename.jpg", 
      "linkedin": "https://linkedin.com/in/username"
    }
  ]
}
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Missing Commas**: Every entry needs a comma after it (except the last one)
2. **Wrong Image Paths**: Make sure photo filenames match exactly
3. **Broken JSON**: Use a [JSON validator](https://jsonlint.com/) to check your file
4. **Large Photos**: Keep photos under 500KB to ensure fast loading
5. **Missing Categories**: General members need a "category" field (senior/junior/etc)

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Website Shows Placeholder Images:
- Check that photo filenames match exactly (including .jpg/.png)
- Verify photos are in `assets/members/` folder
- Make sure photo files aren't corrupted

### Member Cards Not Appearing:
- Validate your JSON file at [jsonlint.com](https://jsonlint.com/)
- Check for missing commas or quotes
- Ensure all required fields are filled

### Website Not Updating:
- Clear your browser cache (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
- Check that files uploaded successfully
- Wait 5-10 minutes for GitHub Pages to update

## üìû Getting Help

1. **Technical Issues**: Contact your web developer or tech-savvy member
2. **JSON Validation**: Use [jsonlint.com](https://jsonlint.com/) to check formatting
3. **Photo Issues**: Use Canva or ask someone to help resize photos
4. **Emergency**: Keep a backup of the working `members.json` file

## üéØ Pro Tips for Efficiency

1. **Batch Updates**: Collect all changes for the week before updating
2. **Template Photos**: Have a standard background/style for consistency  
3. **Backup First**: Always save a copy before making major changes
4. **Test Locally**: Preview changes before uploading if possible
5. **Document Changes**: Keep notes on what you updated each week
