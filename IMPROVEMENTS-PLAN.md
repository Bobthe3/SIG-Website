## 🎯 Member Management System Explanation

### How It Works:
1. **JSON Data File**: All member info stored in `data/members.json` 
2. **Dynamic Loading**: Website reads JSON and creates member cards automatically
3. **Easy Updates**: Change JSON file → website updates instantly
4. **Spreadsheet Workflow**: Use Excel/Google Sheets → Convert to JSON → Upload

### Weekly Update Process:
```
Monday: Collect member updates
Tuesday: Update spreadsheet/JSON
Wednesday: Upload to website  
Thursday: Review and test
Friday: Send updated directory to leadership
```

### Files Created:
- `data/members.json` - Member database
- `scripts/member-loader.js` - Dynamic loading system
- `tools/spreadsheet-converter.html` - CSV to JSON converter
- `MEMBER-MANAGEMENT-GUIDE.md` - Complete instructions
